Much love went into these, some of the system icons are loosely inspired by the Tango Desktop Project.

However the are completely done from scratch.  Hope you enjoy.  Maybe an addon pack will be released if there is enough demand.  

Included is a means to patch your system with the icons (check the Override - Readme), iconpackager themes, and the icons themeselves.

Check out my profile for the rest of the retrofukation suite & please enjoy!

Much gratitude to Matthew (blueslaad), Jared (j3concepts), Mauricio (manicho), Torsten (novoo), Marius (imrik)
For their involvement & contributions to the suite.  Thanks for the amazing work guys.
